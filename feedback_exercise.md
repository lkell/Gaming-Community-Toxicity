#Peer Feedback - 11/05
Did peer feedback with David Miller, Qianlang Chen (Qian) and Jiawen Song (Kevin).

##Feedback

David – we should make sure that we’re not including too much data for JS to handle 
  - Michael added loading transition to the view

David is a big fan of graphs, especially for online communities, so he thinks the graph view would be really neat
  - Implementation for this feature was already in our proposal, but as a Nice to Have. Following the meeting, it was promoted to a Must Have.

David suggests that the graph view could have different levels of semantic meaning (e.g. start with global/overall, zoom to neighborhoods and individual subreddits)
  - Already had a plan to implement this

Other group members stress that we should make sure to have a consistent color scale across all views
  - This was already noted as an action item for the future

Kevin frequents a lot of gaming subreddits and finds our project potentially very interesting
  - Great feedback to ensure we have an audience for our project

David suggests we can incorporate storytelling with larger digraph view
  - We have added this as a Nice to Have feature

Qian things we have a lot of potential for good interaction, but is interested in seeing a holistic mockup
  - Already have implemented total view, but points to the fact that the proposal as we followed instructions made it difficult to cultivate peer feedback

##Feedback on Feedback

Due to the structure of the proposal (e.g. showing brainstorming process instead of a vision for completed product) it was difficult to cultivate useful feedback. Given more time, we could have gotten more useful feedback since we could explain the project more and draft more sketches to help answer their questions as they came up. In other words, having more back and forth would have been useful. Perhaps if we had two class periods instead of just one, this issue might have been resolved.
